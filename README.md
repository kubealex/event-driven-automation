# Introducing Ansible Event Driven Automation

This repo helps in showcasing event driven automation using Event Driven Automation with Ansible.

Currently it is possible to try it out both in a containerized version and using [Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/management/ansible)

To try the containerized version, go in the [EDA Containerized Demo folder](https://github.com/kubealex/eda-podman-demo)

# EDA Ansible Automation Platform Demo

This section handles configuration and preparation to showcase Event Driven Automation leveraging the EDA Controller component in Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform 2.4.

## Use cases

The following use cases are available for testing and/or contributions:

- [AlertManager integration](./docs/use-cases/alertmanager.md) - with Service Now
- [Dynatrace integration](./docs/use-cases/dynatrace.md) - with Service Now
- [Insights integration](./docs/use-cases/insights.md) - with Service Now
- [Webhook integration](./docs/use-cases/webook.md)
- [Kafka integration](./docs/use-cases/kafka.md)
- [MQTT integration](./docs/use-cases/mqtt.md)

## Requirements

### AAP2 configuration

First you need to [install Ansible Automation Platform](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform/2.4/html/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform_installation_guide).

In the [eda-demo-setup directory](./eda-demo-setup/) you will find some useful playbooks to create all necessary resources in the platform to showcase the use cases.

### Network

Some of the use cases (Webhook, Insights, Alertmanager) will need the following ports to be opened on the EDA Controller component:

    5000/tcp - Webhook
    5001/tcp - AlertManager
    5002/tcp - Insights

The Red Hat Insights use case will require that the EDA Machine is reachable from outside your network.

You can use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to set-up a temporary public address to use for the use case, to avoid changing it upon each restart, create a default domain.

### Middleware integration (Kafka, AlertManager, Mosquitto)

The AlertManager and Kafka use cases require a working configuration for them, you can spin up a quick environment using the [podman-compose](./utils/podman-compose/podman-compose.yml) file in the [_utils directory_](./utils/).

This will spin a Kafka, Mosquitto and AlertManager instance running on the host and listening to all interfaces. Tune up the settings based on your needs.

Each component has a dedicated podman-compose file in the [podman-compose directory](./utils/podman-compose/)

**!!! IMPORTANT - CAREFUL !!!**

Carefully read the instructions in [the use cases README](./docs/use-cases/) to properly configure the needed components for the use cases.

### Service Now Integration

One of the use cases include using a [Service Now instance](https://developer.servicenow.com/), you can easily sign-up and get one.

To playbooks in [the configuration folder](./eda-demo-setup/) already have the needed bits to configure credentials and variables to match your instance details.

### Dynatrace integration

The use cases contain a Dynatrace integration.
To configure the integrations, ensure you use your API URL and API Token configured with the following permissions in the [dynatrace rulebook](./eda-ansible/eda-rulebook-dynatrace.yml):

- Read/Write problems
- Read/Write configuration
- Access problem and event feed, metrics, and topology
